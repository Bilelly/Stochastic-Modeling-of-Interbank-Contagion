# Stochastic Modeling of Interbank Contagion

## 📋 Project Overview

This project studies the **stochastic modeling of interbank contagion** and systemic risk in financial networks. It is an academic research project conducted at **CY Tech**

## 🎓 Academic Context

- **Institution**: CY Tech - Ecole d'Ingénieur
- **Program**: 2nd Year Engineering 
- **Specialization**: Applied Mathematics for Finance 
- **Project Supervisor**: Irina Kortchemski (iva@cy-tech.fr)

## 🎯 Project Objectives

This research aims to:
- Model and analyze contagion mechanisms in interbank networks
- Understand systemic risk propagation in financial systems
- Develop stochastic approaches to predict and measure financial contagion
- Provide insights into banking system stability and resilience

## 📊 Methodology

The project employs:
- **Stochastic models** to represent random behavior in financial networks
- **Network analysis** to understand interconnections between financial institutions
- **Monte Carlo simulations** for risk assessment and contagion scenarios
- **Mathematical analysis** using tools from probability theory and financial mathematics
